- 👋 Hi, I’m @nrosenberry
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript & React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely nothing at the moment. I am trying to obtain a second Bachelor's Degree and am very busy.
- 📫 How to reach me: send a message on git, I only get on here once every few months.
